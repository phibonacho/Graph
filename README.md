# Graph
Bad implementation of Graph data type.

Forgive my bad english.

Since I have difficulties even in cooking scrambled eggs, 
I thought that upload a school project as first repository(just to try to understand how github works) would be a great idea.

So, after few days of work I uploaded a first version of the library.
I'm still working on findpath() function, I'm not satisfied of the way I developed the graph's spanningtree.
